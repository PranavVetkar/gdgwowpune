# My Experience at GDG WOW Pune

## Workshop Learnings

During the GDG WOW Pune event, we had the opportunity to learn about several cutting-edge technologies and approaches:

### Multi-modal Content Processing (MCP)
We explored how modern systems can process and understand different forms of content including text, images, audio, and video simultaneously. This technology is fundamental to creating more intelligent and context-aware applications.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
We learned how RAG systems combine the power of retrieval-based approaches with generative AI. This hybrid approach allows AI models to access and utilize external knowledge sources before generating responses, resulting in more accurate and informed outputs.

### Other Topics Covered
- Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications
- Prompt engineering best practices
- Vector databases for efficient similarity search
- Building responsible AI systems

## Community Experience

The collaborative atmosphere at GDG WOW Pune provided an excellent opportunity to network with fellow developers and industry experts. The hands-on workshops and interactive sessions made complex topics more accessible and engaging.

I look forward to applying these learnings in my future projects and continuing to engage with the GDG community!
